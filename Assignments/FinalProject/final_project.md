# CSCE 100: Final Project

For your final project, you must solve a problem or answer a question with what you have learned. You will use either programming to solve a problem, or data analysis to answer a question.

You will work in a group of three.

You will meet to formulate the product of your work, identify who the audience or consumer is and what the output of the project will be. Together, you will give a proposal in class. Your group will then be required to execute on the problem/question, write a two-page report on your efforts and results and present them to the class.

You will be graded together. You will be expected to have input on all phases. Part of your grade will come from your peers.

## Proposal

You must meet as a group to formulate a proposal that you will present to class. In this proposal, you must have three sections. You will discuss these in a short presentation.

1. A description of the problem you are going to solve or question you are going to answer.
2. Who is the intended audience for this?
3. Why do they need this?

## The product

To get credit for this assignment, you must do one of the following:

1. Write a Python program that solves a problem. For example, it may answer a question given an input or it may simulate something. What it does is up to you, but to get credit you must turn in a file with a .ipynb extension on it that I can execute.
2. Using SQLite, answer a question using data and SQL. For example, you might gather data on a topic yourself and analyze it. Or you might obtain data from somewhere else and analyze it. An example of that would be the parking ticket exercise we used in class. To get credit for this, you must turn in a .sqlite file and the necessary SQL to answer the question.

## The report

To get credit for this assignment, you must write a two-page report that, like your proposal, describes the problem/question and then describes the steps you took to solve it. You must answer who the audience is with some research -- how many people are in your intended audience, who are they, etc. You must then discuss how effective your solution is and propose ways to improve it.

## The presentation

To get credit for this part, you must present your problem/question solution to the class. Your presentation must be professional, complete and rehearsed. It must include elements of the written report -- a description of the problem/question, a description of your solution and who it is intended for. Your presentation must include visuals -- a demonstration of your product, graphics to illustrate your data analysis. Your presentation must be no more than 5 minutes and will be presented to the class at an appointed time.

## Peer evaluations

To keep you from not working and blowing off your group, you will be required to review the work of your peers. If your peers report that you didn't come to agreed upon meetings, missed deadlines or didn't contribute, I will assign grades accordingly.

## Grading

The project points will be assigned proportionally as follows:

|Part|Percent|
|----|-------|
|The proposal|5 percent|
|The product|50 percent|
|The report|30 percent|
|The presentation|15 percent|

## Deadline

All materials for the project -- the product, the report, the slides for the presentation -- are all due midnight Wednesday, Nov. 30. The presentations to the class will be done Dec. 1.
