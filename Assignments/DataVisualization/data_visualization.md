#Data visualization#

Data visualization is using shape, color, scale and other visual cues to depict data in a way that the data itself would not communicate well. 


Lecture will cover: 

* Examples 
* Shapes 
* Scale 
* Simplicity
* Graphical excellence
* Graphical narrative
* Don't do this


**In class exercise**

To familiarize you with using shape to visualize data, we're going to use LEGO to visualize a set of data. Divide into groups, determine what your bricks will represent and make a visualization of the data. 

**Homework**

Using a pre-assigned dataset and [this tutorial](http://insights.qunb.com/good-ol-excel-is-the-ultimate-data-visualization-tool-in-most-cases/), visualize data using Microsoft Excel. Then, using [Quartz' Chartbuilder](http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/), visualize the same data. Submit both charts. Using what we talked about in class, which worked better? Which are more readable? Which would Tufte like better?
