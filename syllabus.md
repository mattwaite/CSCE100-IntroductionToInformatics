__Course description:__

If you Google it, Informatics is the science of information systems. But what does that even mean? It means a lot. The field of Informatics ranges across disciplines, covering a wide array of ideas from human-computer interactions to information processing to algorithms that are a part of our everyday lives. This class is an introduction to a number of areas touched by informatics: Problem solving, prototyping, data processing, analysis, programming, algorithms and communicating what you've found.

__Course goal:__

The main goal of the course is to introduce you to the major areas of informatics and to give you a taste of how each area could be used in your academic discipline. The course is designed to give you entry level experience with a range of topics, and to spark ideas of how these tools might fit into your studies. We will hear from practitioners on campus throughout the semester, and we'll try our hands at using the tools and techniques.


__Open lab hours:__

Each Friday throughout the semester, I run something called Maker Hours. It’s an open learning time where anyone who wants to learn about some digital tool or technology can come in and I’ll help. It’s in Andersen Hall Room 27 from 1-5. You’re welcome to come learn something new outside of class, or bring your class stuff with you to get questions answered.

__Texts:__

All reading materials will be online, freely available and assigned week by week.

__Grading:__

I use standard and basic grading scale.

|Grade|Percentage|
|-----|----------|
|A+|97-100|						
|A|93-96|
|A-|90-92|
|B+|87-89|
|B|83-86|
|B-|80-82|
|C+|77-79|
|C|73-76|						
|C-|70-72|
|D+|67-69|
|D|63-66|					 
|D-|60-62|
|F|59 or below|

However, your final letter grade will be weighted:
|Assignment|Weight||----------|------|
|Assignments/quizzes|40%||Midterm test|25%||Final project|35%|

__Notes on attendance:__

Yes, we all get sick. Yes, things happen. I don’t want you to be sick in my class any more than you want to be sick. You’ve got no fewer than five ways to get ahold of me. If you are going to miss class, tell me before class. We’ll work it out. But you have to tell me before class for me to help you.

This said: this class builds each class onto the next one. Miss a class, especially a code class, and you are behind. You’re going to be covering a lot of new material in this class. Miss one at your own peril.

I don't take attendance. You're an adult. You're paying money to be here. Show up. I'll notice you being here and being a part of the class. I'll also know when you aren't here. And when it comes time to give grades at the end of the semester, how interested I am in rounding your grade up because you're close will be entirely determined by how much you were a part of class.

__Policies__Here's the short version.You cheat, you fail, no exceptions. If I’m doing something that’s keeping you from learning, tell me. Tell the Dean. Tell someone, because that’s not cool. I won’t tolerate it from myself and you shouldn’t either.
Now the longer versions.
__Academic integrity:__

Every student must adhere to the policy on academic integrity set forth in the UNL Student Code of Conduct as outlined in the UNL Bulletin. Students who plagiarize may receive a failing grade on an assignment or for an entire course and may be reported to the Student Judicial Review Board. The work a student submits in a class must be the student's own work and must be work completed for that particular class and assignment. Students wishing to build on an old project or work on a similar project in two classes must discuss this with both professors.

Academic dishonesty includes:

* Handing in another's work or part of another's work as your own.
* Turning in one of your old papers (including something you wrote in high school) for a current class.
* turning in the same or similar paper for two different classes, using notes or other study aids or otherwise obtaining another's answers for a quiz or an examination.

Anything and everything you include in your papers that comes from another source must be attributed with proper citation. That includes ideas and opinions.

Plagiarism consists of using phrases, sentences or paragraphs from any source and republishing them without alteration or attribution. The sources include, but are not limited to, books, magazines, newspapers, television or radio reports, Web sites and other students’ papers.

__Students with disabilities:__

Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation. It is the policy of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office, 132 Canfield Administration, (402) 472-3787 voice or TTY.

__Diversity:__

The University of Nebraska-Lincoln values diversity, in the broadest sense of the word – gender, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, income, religion, education, geographic, physical and mental ability or disability, sexual orientation. We recognize that understanding and incorporating diversity in the curriculum enables us to prepare our students for careers as professionals in a global society. As professionals, we understand that our work must reflect society in order to be effective and reliable.

## Class Schedule
A word of warning: The course schedule is subject to change. I will update it regularly on Canvas and will inform the class when I do.
