__Course description:__

If you Google it, Informatics is the science of information systems. But what does that even mean? It means a lot. The field of Informatics ranges across disciplines, covering a wide array of ideas from human-computer interactions to information processing to algorithms that are a part of our everyday lives. This class is an introduction to a number of areas touched by informatics: Problem solving, prototyping, data processing, analysis, programming, algorithms and communicating what you've found.

__Course goal:__

The main goal of the course is to introduce you to the major areas of informatics and to give you a taste of how each area could be used in your academic discipline. The course is designed to give you entry level experience with a range of topics, and to spark ideas of how these tools might fit into your studies. We will hear from practitioners on campus throughout the semester, and we'll try our hands at using the tools and techniques.
